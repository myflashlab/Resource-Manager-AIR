# The Resource Manager Software for Adobe AIR V1.0.1

![The Resource Manager Software for Adobe AIR](http://www.myflashlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/myflashlabs-resource-manager-tool.jpg)

This software is designed for Adobe AIR developers to enable them to easily explore and edit or modify the resources available in any ANE (AIR Native Extension) files.

Some ANEs include resource files in them and if you ever wished to modify those resources in your AIR app, this free software can be a great help to you. It will save your time and makes sure you're not doing any human mistakes.

This software has been exclusively tested with [MyFlashLabs ANEs](http://www.myflashlabs.com/?shop_page=2851) but you still can use it with other modern ANEs.

As a quick example, some ANEs like the [RichWebview](https://github.com/myflashlab/webView-ANE) or [Firebase fcm](https://github.com/myflashlab/Firebase-ANE) have some icons/resources in their ANEs and you will not be able to easily modify these ANEs yourself unless you have a software designed for this reason.
